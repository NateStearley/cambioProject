Coding
  - Use design pattern(s) to implement your new feature(s)
    - Brainstorm different design patterns, your first choice may not always be the best one.
    - If mid-way through your coding process, you see a better way to implement things, by all means try it out
  - Place all of the newly created classes inside the libs/transit folder

Important: If your code does not compile on CSElabs machines, you won’t receive credit for the coding section.

Documentation 
  - Doxygen
    - Doxygen for ALL of the classes (existing and newly created)
    - You are NOT required to do doxygen for the classes under these folder
      - dependencies/
      - libs/routing/ 
      - libs/transit/util/
      - apps/
    - Doxyfile and the generated materials from doxygen (i.e., index.html,...)
  - Google Code Style
    - Code Style for ALL of the classes (existing and newly created)
    - You are not required to do code styling for the classes under these folder
      - dependencies/
      - libs/routing/ 
      - libs/transit/util/
      - apps/
  - Write Up
    - File Name: README.md (should be located in the GitHub repository)
    - Team number, member names, and x500.
    - What is the project about (overview of the whole project, not just the hw4)?
    - How to run the simulation (overview of the whole project, not just the hw4)?
    - What does the simulation do specifically (individual features ie movement of entities etc) (overview of the whole project, not just the hw4)?
    - New Feature
      - What does it do?
      - Why is it significantly interesting?
      - How does it add to the existing work? 
      - Which design pattern did you choose to implement it and why? 
      - Instruction to use this new feature (if the new feature is not user interactable, please mention this as well)
    - Sprint retrospective
  - UML
    - Create UML diagram depicting ONLY your new feature
    - Upload this to the github repo and also display this in the aforementioned README file

Docker
  - Upload and push your final code to DockerHub
  - Put this link inside the GitHub README (be sure to state what the link is about).

YouTube Video Presentation (~5 min)
  - Explain the new feature that your team has implemented 
    - What is it?
    - Why is this new feature important?
    - Which design pattern did you use?
    - Demo
    - Optional: Source code if you have more time
    - Everyone in the team must talk with video cameras on
You can upload this video to YouTube and put the link that will redirect toward your video inside the README (be sure to state what the link is about). 
Make sure the teaching staff has access to this video. Feel free to set it to private or delete it once you have received your final score.

Peer Review
  - Peer reviews are individual. You will assign a value for each team member in your group. 
    The total will add up to 100. For example, if you have 2 people, you could do 50-50. 
    There will also be a portion where you list each member’s responsibilities. If a peer review comes back and a member has a 0, 
    we will check your team’s GitHub commits. If they have 0 commits, they will receive a 0 on homework 4.
  - Review your teammates by filling out the form below.
  - This is due on Friday, May 5th at 11:59 pm.
